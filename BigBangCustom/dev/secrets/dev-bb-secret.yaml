metadata:
    # This is the standard Kubernetes resource metadata block. It describes who the resource is and where it lives,
    # not the secret's actual data.
    #
    # Big Bang's HelmRelease expects this exact name to overlay values (e.g., registry creds).
    name: dev-bb-secret
    # Big Bang and Flux run in this namespace; the secret must live here to be used.
    namespace: bigbang

# Flux/Big Bang merge this into the main values when present.
stringData:
    # These are Inline Helm values merged with configmap values. Big Bang requries the name to be "values.yaml".
