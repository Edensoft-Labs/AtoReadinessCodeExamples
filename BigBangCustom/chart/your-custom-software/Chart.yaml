# The Helm chart for the custom software application.

# DEFINE THE API VERSION.
# The schema version for this chart metadata file, not your app's API version and not Kubernetes’ apiVersion for resources.
# v2 means this chart uses the Helm 3 chart format. It enables/standardizes Helm 3-era metadata features (like a richer dependencies model, library charts, etc.).
apiVersion: v2

# DEFINE THE CHART VERSION.
# The version number of this chart itself (note that this is different from the software version below).
version: 1.0.1

# DEFINE THE CHART NAME.
# The name of this chart itself, not the Kubernetes app name and not the Helm release name.
name: your-custom-software

# DEFINE THE APPLICATION TYPE.
# The type has two common values:
# - application: A chart that deploys an app/workload (Deployments, Services, Ingress, etc.). This is the default/most common.
# - library: A chart that does not deploy resources by itself; it provides shared templates/helpers for other charts to reuse (consumed via dependencies).
# The custom software deployed in this chart is clearly an application.
type: application

# DEFINE THE APPLICATION VERSION AND METADATA.
# The version number of our custom software contained in the custom software containers referenced in this chart.
# This should match the version number encoded in those containers.
appVersion: "1.0.0.0"
# Metadata that might be helpful for locating our containers in a Big Bang deployment, where other software might be deployed alongside ours.
